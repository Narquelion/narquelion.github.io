# **About Me**

Hi! My name is **{{ site.author.name }}**  (they/them/theirs). :wave:

I am a second-year in the linguistics department at the University of Michigan.

Currently, I am working on change in constituent order flexibility through multiple projects. My primary research, which I am conducting for my Qualifying Research Paper, concerns the acceptability of non-canonical constituent orders among Japanese-English bilinguals in the greater Detroit area.

More broadly, my research investigates the interaction between cognitive processes and social  factors, how this interaction contributes to long-term language change (particularly morphosyntactic change), and what contact-induced change can tell us about speakers' linguistic representations and the processes underlying cross-linguistic patterns. I am especially interested in the application of computational modeling to questions in language contact, and in how these models can incorporate findings from various subfields to produce a coherent picture of language change in individuals and groups.
