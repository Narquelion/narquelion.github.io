## Consonants

Pashatham features a large inventory of fricatives, but---perhaps somehwhat conspicuously---lacks [z]. (This is because [z] is a bad sound. \\s) Aside from this, though, its consonant inventory is fairly simple.

|                 | Bilab. | Lbd. | Alv. | Rtf. | Pal. | Vel. | Uvu. | Glt. |
|:----------------|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| **Nasal**       |	m        |             | n        |           |         | ŋ     |        |         |
| **Plosive**     |	p        |             | t	      |	          |         | k     | q      |         |
| **Fricative**   |	ɸ	β      | þ ð         | s        | ʂ ʐ       | ɕ       | x     |	       | h       |
| **Affricate**   |          |             | t͡s       |           | t͡ɕ      |       |        |         |
| **Lat. Appx.**  |          |             | l        |           |         |       |        |         |							
| **Appx.**       |	         |             |          |           | j	      |       |        |         |
| **Trill**       |          |             | r        |           |         |       |        |         |
| **Flap**        |          |             | [ɾ]      |           |         |       |        |         |

All consonants may be geminated; for example *uutta* [u:tta] 'that', *uuppŭ* [u:ppɯ] 'this', *sejâssâ* [sejæs:æ] 'nine', *ôyśśâân* [öyɕ:æ:n] 'to die', *le̊nauhhat* [lənauh:at] 'it (inan.) visited'.

### Allophony

[ɾ] is a word-medial allophone of /r/; however, geminate /r/ is realized as [r:]. C.f. *rââriź* [ræ:ɾiʐ] 'child', *joohme̊rrur* [jo:mər:ur] 'he/she/they is/are sleeping'.

## Vowels

Vowels may be short or long and are subject to front-back vowel harmony. The front vowels are /i y e ø æ/, and the corresponding back vowels are /ɯ u ə o a/.

|           | Front              | Central            | Back      |
|:----------|:------------------:|:------------------:|:---------:|
| Close     |	i i: y y:          |                    | ɯ ɯ: u u: |
| Close-mid |	e e: ø ø:          |                    | o o:      |
| Mid       |                    | ə ə:               | 		      |
| Near-open | æ [æ~ɛ̞] æ: [æ:~ɛ̞:] | 		                |           |
| Open      |                    | a [a~ɑ] a: [a:~ɑ:] |           |

The vowels that surface in an affix are determined by the root to which the affix is attached. For example, *ljŭŭqśaap* [lʲɯːqɕa:p] 'adult human' + *-In* [In] 'to be (anim.)' → *ljŭŭqśaapŭn* [lʲɯːqɕa:pɯn] 'to be an adult'. In noun compounds, the second noun typically determines vowel harmony; however, some compounds behave idiosyncratically.

## Phonotactics

Stop consonant clusters must agree in place; the preceeding stop assimilates in these features to the following one. For example, *pakŭt* [pakɯt] 'eight' + *-kAm* [kAm] 'ordinal number suffix' → *pakŭkkam* [pakɯkkam] 'eighth'.

Fricative-stop clusters are allowed (ex. veśti [βeɕti] 'wind'), but must agree in voicing. Stop-fricative clusters, however, are present only in roots. When affixation would result in such clusters, the stop assimilates fully to the following fricative. For example, *ćyyšyyt* [t͡ɕy:ʂy:t] 'field' + *-šEE* [ʂE:] 'locative suffix' → *ćyyšyyššee* [t͡ɕy:ʂy:ʂ:e:].
