A self-described “sort ‘em up”, [PALACE OF WOE](https://owch.itch.io/palace-of-woe) by [owch](https://owch.itch.io/) is a transformative puzzle adventure featuring an intriguing and, at times, highly challenging multidirectional-Testris-like battle system. Enemies and music reminiscent OFF give the top-down, GameBoy-esque world an eerie atmosphere despite its pastel color scheme. Although unsettling on the surface, reaching the end of the game (a few-hours-long endeavor) was cathartic and---to my surprise---deeply personal.
