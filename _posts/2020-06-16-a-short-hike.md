On a whimsical island that manages to evoke a number of both classics and newer games without feeling stilted, [A Short Hike](https://ashorthike.com) by [adamgryu](https://adamgryu.com/) brings together elements of *Animal Crossing*, *Legend of Zelda*, *A Night in the Woods*, and *Celeste* to produce a moving journey with plenty of exploring to do on the side. From its colorful art and clever dialogue---sometimes impressively real, other times downright silly---to the layered situational [music](https://marksparling.bandcamp.com/album/a-short-hike-original-soundtrack), all aspects of the game are deeply expressive. Even the physics of walking and flying seemed to fit the game---trekking uphill feels suitably difficult; diving through the air is exhilarating. Though its main goal can be completed within an hour or two, I found it hard to step away.
