The bright, pixel-y world of [ᗢ](https://tak.itch.io/meow) by [tak](https://tak.itch.io/) invites exploration, and getting to wander it as a small black cat only sweetens the deal. Despite spending much of the game feeling hopelessly lost, its subtle pathfinding kept me moving in (mostly) the right direction. The ending was sweet; definitely a game worth playing.
