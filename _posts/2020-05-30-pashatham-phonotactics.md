Stop consonant clusters must agree in place; the preceeding stop assimilates in these features to the following one. For example, *pakŭt* [pakɯt] 'eight' + *-kAm* [kAm] 'ordinal number suffix' → *pakŭkkam* [pakɯkkam] 'eighth'.

Fricative-stop clusters are allowed (ex. veśti [βeɕti] 'wind'), but must agree in voicing. Stop-fricative clusters, however, are present only in roots. When affixation would result in such clusters, the stop assimilates fully to the following fricative. For example, *ćyyšyyt* [t͡ɕy:ʂy:t] 'field' + *-šEE* [ʂE:] 'locative suffix' → *ćyyšyyššee* [t͡ɕy:ʂy:ʂ:e:].
