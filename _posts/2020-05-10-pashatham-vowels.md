Vowels may be short or long and are subject to front-back vowel harmony. The front vowels are /i y e ø æ/, and the corresponding back vowels are /ɯ u ə o a/.

|           | Front              | Central            | Back      |
|:----------|:------------------:|:------------------:|:---------:|
| Close     |	i i: y y:          |                    | ɯ ɯ: u u: |
| Close-mid |	e e: ø ø:          |                    | o o:      |
| Mid       |                    | ə ə:               | 		      |
| Near-open | æ [æ~ɛ̞] æ: [æ:~ɛ̞:] | 		                |           |
| Open      |                    | a [a~ɑ] a: [a:~ɑ:] |           |

The vowels that surface in an affix are determined by the root to which the affix is attached. For example, *ljŭŭqśaap* [lʲɯːqɕa:p] 'adult human' + *-In* [In] 'to be (anim.)' → *ljŭŭqśaapŭn* [lʲɯːqɕa:pɯn] 'to be an adult'. In noun compounds, the second noun typically determines vowel harmony; however, some compounds behave idiosyncratically.
